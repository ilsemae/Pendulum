There are a total of 9 different simulations. All but one can be run using 
runner.m. Open this file and uncomment one of lines 15, 18, 22, 26, 30, 
34, 37, or 41 to run a simulation. To run the last simulation, "string of 
lights," open and run "runner_lights.m" 

To compare different derivation methods for the triple pendulum or for the 
"branched pendulum," open and run "lagrange_vs_AMB_vs_DAEs.m." 

Initial conditions for all of these can be set at the top of the files.
